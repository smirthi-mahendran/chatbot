		<h2> What is Chatbot? </h2>
		<p>
		A bot is a program that automatically completes an action based on specific triggers and algorithms. A chatbot is a computer program that’s designed to simulate human conversation. Users communicate with these tools using a chat interface or via voice, just like they would converse with another person. 
		Chatbots interpret the words given to them by a person and provide a pre-set answer.<br><br>
		Chatbots, like regular applications, have application layers, databases, conversational user interfaces (CUIs) and APIs. There are 3 common kinds of a chatbot available today:
		<br><br>
		<strong>Rule-based chatbots:</strong> The most straightforward option, these bots simply provide a pre-defined answer to very specific questions. These bots are great for things like qualifying leads or offering customers an interactive FAQ experience
		<br><br><strong>Intelligent chatbots:</strong> These intelligent bots use machine learning or “ML” to learn from the user’s requests and information. Intellectual bots are trained to understand specific words and phrases that trigger a reply. They teach themselves over time to understand more questions and deliver better answers
		<br><br><strong>AI-powered chatbots:</strong> These bots combine the benefits of rule-based bots with the power of intellectually independent programs to solve user problems. They can remember the context of conversations and understand user preferences. These bots use a combination of natural language processing, machine learning, and AI to understand customers. Natural language processing helps the interactions between humans and computers to feel more natural
